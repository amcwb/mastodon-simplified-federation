* **New:** All network requests e.g. to the Mastodon API now have a timeout of five seconds to handle servers not responding correctly. ([#72](https://github.com/rugk/mastodon-simplified-federation/pull/72))
* **Fixed:** A bug has been fixed that could cause an issue with redirection of toot interactions when the toot is only  available to authenticated users via the Mastodon API. ([#71](https://github.com/rugk/mastodon-simplified-federation/issues/71))
* **Fixed:** A bug has been fixed that resulted in the redirection not being catched in case of newer Friendica versions. ([#62](https://github.com/rugk/mastodon-simplified-federation/issues/62))
* **Improved:** The translation for French has been updated, thanks to [@le-jun](https://github.com/le-jun).
